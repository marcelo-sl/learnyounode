 # LEARN YOU THE NODE.JS FOR MUCH WIN!  
   
 ## HELLO WORLD (Exercise 1 of 13)  
   
  Create a file named hello-world.js.  
   
  Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console  
  (stdout).  
   
 ## HINTS  
   
  To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and  
  start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the node  
  command. e.g.:  
   
     $ node hello-world.js  
   
  You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:  
   
     console.log('text')  
   
  When you are done, you must run:  
   
     $ learnyounode verify hello-world.js
